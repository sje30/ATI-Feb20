# Description
Speakers: Dr James V Stone, Dr Stephen J Eglen, Mr Lancelot da Costa

Requirements: Working knowledge of vector, matrices and differentiation. For practical exercises, working knowledge of Python will be assumed. Students should bring their own laptops to the lab session.

Cancellation: Please note we have introduced a new cancellation policy which you can review here

The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to deep
learning methods. No prior experience of deep learning/neural networks
is required. The workshop will be mostly lectures followed by a lab
session.

## Computer requirements

Please install python on your laptop; we recommend
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to install all
the prerequisites.  If you prefer, you can install
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and then
install the following packages:

```
conda install numpy matplotlib spyder jupyter
```

### Lab files

1. No hidden layer [practical/xor.py](practical/xor.py)
2. One hidden layer [practical/main.py](practical/main.py)
3. [MNIST in Keras](https://raw.githack.com/sje30/dl2019/master/mnist/mnist_bp.html)
